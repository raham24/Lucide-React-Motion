# Signature animations — authoring guide

This is the contributor-facing reference for writing `mode="signature"`
animations. It describes the architecture, the two-tier rule the
project follows, the step-by-step workflow for adding a signature, and
a roadmap of which icon families to tackle next.

> Read this end-to-end before authoring your first signature. Three
> things in particular matter and trip people up: matching paths by
> data not by index, picking the right tier per path, and reusing
> motions across variants instead of re-typing physics.

## 1. The goal

Every Lucide icon should eventually have a unique, true-to-life
animation when consumers set `mode="signature"`. The bar is the bell:
the shell rocks from its top mount, the clapper swings as a free
pendulum inside, sound waves radiate outward from the mount. Each
motion is physics-aware and characteristic to what the icon depicts.

Icons without a registered signature fall back to `mode="draw"` (the
default stroke-on) and emit a one-time dev warning, so coverage gaps
are visible during development but never break consumer apps.

## 2. How signatures work

A **signature** is a `Mode` value associated with a specific icon. The
generated wrapper for that icon (`src/generated/<name>.tsx`) imports
its signature and forwards it to `<DrawIcon signature={signature} />`.
When the consumer sets `mode="signature"`, the engine resolves to that
Mode and calls its factory once per path in the icon.

Signatures are built by composing **Motion modules**. A Motion is a
small self-describing per-path animation:

```ts
interface Motion {
  matches: (ctx: ModeContext) => boolean;     // does this motion drive this path?
  factory: (ctx: ModeContext) => Variants;    // how does the path animate?
}
```

The `compose()` helper assembles motions into a Mode. At render time,
the engine iterates over the icon's paths and calls the signature's
factory for each one. The factory tries each Motion's `matches`
predicate in order; the first that returns true provides the variants.
Paths that don't match anything fall back to the default `"draw"`
factory and emit a dev warning.

### Match helpers

Three helpers cover almost every case:

```ts
matchPathD("M3.262 15.326…")     // matches one specific <path> by its d
matchPathDOneOf(d1, d2, d3)      // matches any of several known d strings
matchAnyPath                     // matches every path (whole-icon motion)
```

For non-path SVG elements (`<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`), write a
custom predicate that inspects `ctx.pathTag` and `ctx.pathAttrs`.
Attribute values are typed `string | number`, so wrap in `String(...)`
to compare defensively — Lucide emits them as strings today but the
type allows either:

```ts
matches: (ctx) =>
  ctx.pathTag === "circle" &&
  String(ctx.pathAttrs.cx) === "18" &&
  String(ctx.pathAttrs.r) === "3",
```

### What `ctx` carries

```ts
interface ModeContext {
  iconName: string;                                // "bell", "heart", …
  index: number;                                   // path index in the icon
  pathTag: string;                                 // "path", "circle", …
  pathAttrs: Record<string, string | number>;      // the path's attrs
  duration: number;                                // resolved timing
  delay: number;
  stagger: number;
  easing: Easing | Easing[];
  repeat: number;
}
```

`duration`/`delay`/`stagger`/`easing`/`repeat` are fully resolved by
the time the factory runs (per-icon prop > `MotionIconConfig` >
mode-preferred defaults > engine defaults). Factories use them
verbatim — never hand-roll prop fallbacks inside a motion.

## 3. The two-tier rule

The single most important judgment call when authoring a signature.
For each non-base path in an icon, classify it into one of two tiers:

**Tier 1 — UI / state markers.** Plus, minus, check, ×, slash,
off-mark, dot indicator, badge, etc. These are abstract semantic
decorations whose purpose is to *signify a state* (added, removed,
confirmed, silenced, has-notification). They don't represent anything
physical, so they shouldn't animate physically. Use:

- `modifierReveal` — the generic pathLength + opacity draw-in for path
  elements
- `dotReveal` — the circle-equivalent (scale + opacity) for circle
  elements

Drop them last in the compose `motions` list (after any base-shape
motions). They draw in quietly and don't compete with the host icon's
primary motion.

**Tier 2 — Real-life-grounded elements.** Sound waves, flames, water
drops, smoke, sparkles, light rays, electricity, lightning bolts —
anything that depicts an actual physical phenomenon. These get bespoke
motion that mimics how the real thing behaves: sound waves radiate
outward, flames flicker, water drops fall, smoke drifts upward. The
motion *is* the icon's character.

**Concrete examples already in the codebase:**

| Path | Tier | Motion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bell-plus` / `bell-minus` / `bell-check` / `bell-off`'s modifier | 1 | `modifierReveal` |
| `bell-dot`'s dot circle | 1 | `dotReveal` |
| `bell-ring`'s sound waves | **2** | `bellSoundWaves` (radiates outward from mount) |
| The bell shell + clapper themselves | **2** | `bellShell` + `bellClapper` (pendulum physics) |
| The heart's outline | **2** | `heartBeat` (lub-dub) |

When in doubt, ask: "does this path depict an actual physical thing
that has its own motion in the real world, or is it a marker?" If the
former, design Tier 2 motion. If the latter, just `modifierReveal`.

## 4. Authoring workflow

The end-to-end process for adding a signature to one icon. Repeat per
icon in the family you're working on.

### Step 1 — Inspect the icon

Open `src/generated/<icon-name>.tsx`. Look at the `nodes` array. Note:

- How many paths the icon has
- The `d` string (or geometry for `<circle>` / `<rect>`) of each
- Which path represents what in the real-world thing the icon depicts

Compare visually if needed — `https://lucide.dev/icons/<name>` shows
the rendered icon, or render it locally via the playground.

### Step 2 — Decide per-path motion

For each path, ask in order:

1. **Does an existing motion module already match this path?** Check
   `src/modes/motions/`. Look for matching `d` strings or matching
   element geometry. If yes → just import it and move on.

2. **Is this path part of a family?** If the icon is a variant (e.g.
   `heart-crack`), check whether the family-base motion module
   (`heartBeat`) recognizes this path. If it almost matches but the
   `d` differs slightly, extend the motion's `matchPathDOneOf` list
   with the new `d` (only if the path's visual role and motion should
   be identical — otherwise create a new variant motion).

3. **Is this a Tier 1 marker?** Use `modifierReveal` (for paths) or
   `dotReveal` (for circles).

4. **Is this Tier 2?** Write a new motion module under
   `src/modes/motions/`. Name it `<icon>-<role>.ts` (e.g. `flame-core`,
   `clock-hour-hand`).

### Step 3 — Write any new motion modules

Each module exports a single `Motion` value. Match strictly by path
data. Animate using `ctx` for all timing. Document the motion's intent
in a top-of-file JSDoc and reference which icons consume it.

Example skeleton (hypothetical — `flame` doesn't have a signature yet;
this is what one might look like):

```ts
import { matchPathD, type Motion } from "../compose";

const FLAME_CORE_D = "M…"; // paste from src/generated/flame.tsx

export const flameCore: Motion = {
  matches: matchPathD(FLAME_CORE_D),
  factory: (ctx) => ({
    rest:   { scale: 1, opacity: 1 },
    active: {
      scale:   [1, 1.08, 0.95, 1.05, 1],
      opacity: [1, 0.7, 1, 0.85, 1],
      transition: {
        duration: ctx.duration,
        delay:    ctx.delay + ctx.index * ctx.stagger,
        ease:     "easeInOut",
        repeat:   ctx.repeat,
      },
    },
  }),
};
```

For real reference, read any of the existing `motions/*.ts` files —
`bell-clapper.ts` and `bell-sound-waves.ts` are particularly good
examples of physics-aware Tier 2 motion.

### Step 4 — Write the signature

`src/modes/signatures/<icon>.ts`. Thin compose() call:

```ts
import { compose } from "../compose";
import { flameCore } from "../motions/flame-core";
import { flameOuter } from "../motions/flame-outer";

/**
 * Flame flickers — inner core wobbles faster than the outer tongue,
 * mimicking the way a real flame's heart is more active than its
 * envelope.
 */
export default compose({
  motions: [flameCore, flameOuter],
  defaults: { duration: 1.0, easing: "easeInOut", stagger: 0 },
  // No transformOrigin override — flame scales around the icon center.
});
```

Put more specific motions earlier in the list. Wildcard
(`matchAnyPath`) motions go last.

### Step 5 — Regenerate

```bash
pnpm --filter lucide-react-motion generate
```

The codegen detects the new signature file and re-emits the icon's
generated wrapper with the signature import + `signature={signature}`
prop wired up.

### Step 6 — Validate

```bash
pnpm typecheck     # from repo root, fans out to all workspaces
pnpm --filter lucide-react-motion test
```

Both should pass before you ask for review.

### Step 7 — Visual review

Open `/playground` and use the mode toggle next to the search bar to
set `signature`. Search for the icon(s) you added. Hover each one and
verify the animation reads correctly. Things to check:

- Does the motion match what the real-world thing does?
- Are Tier 1 modifiers quiet enough that they don't compete with the
  host motion?
- Does the icon respect the duration / easing without feeling
  abruptly cut off?
- Try it at `size={56}` AND `size={120}` — some motions look great
  small but exaggerated when large (or vice versa).
- Try a few triggers (hover, click) to make sure replay feels right.

### Step 8 — Hand off for review

Commit the new motions + signatures. The user reviews the family
visually and either signs off or requests adjustments. After sign-off,
move to the next family.

## 5. Worked example — the bell family

Reference implementation. Open these files in tandem when reading this
section: `src/modes/motions/bell-*.ts` and
`src/modes/signatures/bell-*.ts`.

The Lucide bell has two paths that recur across most variants:

- `M10.268 21a2 2 0 0 0 3.464 0` — the clapper bob (small curve at the
  bottom)
- `M3.262 15.326…` — the bell shell (the body)

Each variant adds modifier paths on top of these two:

| Variant | Adds |
| --- | --- |
| `bell-plus` | `+` (two short lines) |
| `bell-minus` | `−` (horizontal line) |
| `bell-check` | `✓` (checkmark) |
| `bell-off` | `/` (diagonal slash) |
| `bell-ring` | two sound-wave arcs |
| `bell-dot` | small `<circle>` notification |

Some variants reshape the base shell to make room for the modifier
(`bell-off` has a split shell, `bell-plus` carves out the top-right
corner). The `bellShell` motion lists all known shell `d` strings in a
`matchPathDOneOf` so every variant inherits the same rocking physics.

**Base bell** (`signatures/bell.ts`):

```ts
import { compose } from "../compose";
import { bellClapper } from "../motions/bell-clapper";
import { bellShell } from "../motions/bell-shell";

export default compose({
  motions: [bellClapper, bellShell],
  defaults: { duration: 1.0, easing: "easeOut", stagger: 0 },
  transformOrigin: "12px 4px",   // top mount, not icon center
});
```

**Tier 1 variants** — every `*-plus`, `*-minus`, `*-check`, `*-off`
ends up identical except for the modifier intent. The same motions
list works because `modifierReveal` is `matchAnyPath` (it catches
whatever's left after clapper + shell match):

```ts
// signatures/bell-plus.ts (bell-minus, bell-check, bell-off are identical)
import { compose } from "../compose";
import { bellClapper } from "../motions/bell-clapper";
import { bellShell } from "../motions/bell-shell";
import { modifierReveal } from "../motions/modifier-reveal";

export default compose({
  motions: [bellClapper, bellShell, modifierReveal],
  defaults: { duration: 1.0, easing: "easeOut", stagger: 0 },
  transformOrigin: "12px 4px",
});
```

**Tier 1 variant with a circle** — `bell-dot` has a notification dot
that's a `<circle>`, not a path. `dotReveal` matches it by geometry:

```ts
// signatures/bell-dot.ts
import { compose } from "../compose";
import { bellClapper } from "../motions/bell-clapper";
import { bellShell } from "../motions/bell-shell";
import { dotReveal } from "../motions/dot-reveal";

export default compose({
  motions: [bellClapper, bellShell, dotReveal],
  defaults: { duration: 1.0, easing: "easeOut", stagger: 0 },
  transformOrigin: "12px 4px",
});
```

**Tier 2 variant** — `bell-ring` has actual sound waves that need
radiation physics. Bespoke motion:

```ts
// signatures/bell-ring.ts
import { compose } from "../compose";
import { bellClapper } from "../motions/bell-clapper";
import { bellShell } from "../motions/bell-shell";
import { bellSoundWaves } from "../motions/bell-sound-waves";

export default compose({
  motions: [bellClapper, bellShell, bellSoundWaves],
  defaults: { duration: 1.0, easing: "easeOut", stagger: 0 },
  transformOrigin: "12px 4px",
});
```

`bellSoundWaves` matches the two wave `d` strings via
`matchPathDOneOf` and scales each wave from 0 around the bell's mount
pivot — so the waves visually emerge from where the bell hangs and
propagate outward, the way real sound waves do.

**Result**: six variants, ~80 lines of new code, zero re-typed bell
physics. The shared motion modules are the single source of truth.

## 6. Reusable motions currently available

When authoring a new signature, check this list first. If an existing
motion matches the path you're animating, just import and reuse.

| Module | Matches | Animates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `motions/bell-clapper.ts` | Bell clapper d | Wider damped pendulum, ~6 swings |
| `motions/bell-shell.ts` | All known bell shell d variants | Gentle damped rotation, ~3.5 swings |
| `motions/bell-sound-waves.ts` | Bell-ring wave d's | Radiating pulses out from origin (Tier 2) |
| `motions/modifier-reveal.ts` | `matchAnyPath` (wildcard) | Generic pathLength + opacity draw-in (Tier 1) |
| `motions/dot-reveal.ts` | Circle at cx=18,cy=5,r=3 | Scale + opacity for notification dots (Tier 1) |
| `motions/heart-beat.ts` | Heart base d | Lub-dub scale beat (Tier 2) |
| `motions/eye-blink.ts` | `matchAnyPath` for eye | scaleY collapse + return |
| `motions/star-twinkle.ts` | Star base d | Combined rotate + scale + opacity |
| `motions/sun-rotate.ts` | `matchAnyPath` for sun | Slow rotation (via `atom/spin`) |
| `motions/loader-spin.ts` | `matchAnyPath` for loader | Infinite rotation (via `atom/spin`) |
| `motions/atom/spin.ts` | (factory only, no matches) | Pure rotation math; reused by spin Mode + sun/loader |

Update this table when you add a new motion module.

## 7. Family roadmap

Suggested priority order. Each family is self-contained — finish one,
get review, then start the next. The user picks the queue order; this
is a recommendation.

**Tier-2-rich families (highest impact):**

1. **`heart-*`** — heart, heart-crack, heart-handshake, heart-off,
   heart-pulse. Already have base `heartBeat`. Variants need: crack-
   line reveal (Tier 1), handshake clasp (Tier 2?), off-slash (Tier
   1), pulse-line (Tier 2 ECG-style sweep).

2. **`clock-*`** — clock, clock-{1..12}, alarm-clock, alarm-clock-*,
   timer, timer-*, watch, hourglass. Each clock variant needs hour-
   hand (slow tick) and minute-hand (faster tick) animated
   independently; face is static. Hourglass is its own thing (sand
   fall, Tier 2).

3. **`sun-*` / `moon-*`** — sun, sunrise, sunset, sun-medium, sun-
   snow, sun-dim, sun-moon, moon, moon-star. Sun already done.
   Rotational variants reuse `sun-rotate`. moon-star adds a Tier 2
   twinkle.

4. **`cloud-*` + `droplet*`** — cloud, cloud-drizzle, cloud-fog,
   cloud-hail, cloud-lightning, cloud-rain, cloud-snow, cloud-sun,
   droplet, droplets, umbrella. Tier 2 cloud drift, Tier 2 rain fall,
   Tier 2 lightning flash.

5. **`flame*` / `fire`** — flame, flame-kindling, fire, candle (if
   present). Tier 2 flicker on each flame layer.

6. **`loader-*` / `refresh-*` / `rotate-*`** — loader-circle, loader-
   pinwheel, refresh-ccw, refresh-cw, rotate-cw, rotate-ccw, repeat-
   *. Most reuse infinite-spin. Refresh icons may have a partial-arc
   variant.

7. **`wifi-*` / `signal-*` / `volume-*`** — wifi, wifi-{high,low,off,
   zero}, signal, signal-{high,low,medium,zero}, volume, volume-x,
   volume-1, volume-2. Tier 2 wave/bar radiation from center
   outward.

**Tier-1-dominant families (medium impact):**

8. **`battery-*`** — battery, battery-charging, battery-full, battery-
   low, battery-medium, battery-warning. Cell-fill cascade is Tier 2
   (state-aware fill animation).

9. **`mail-*` / `send`** — mail, mail-open, mail-plus, send, send-
   horizontal. Envelope flap is Tier 2; send is paper-plane flight.

10. **`mic-*` / `mic-off`** — microphone pulsing during active state,
    cross-out for off variant.

**Directional and UI families (lower impact, can be done fast in
batches):**

11. **`arrow-*` / `chevron-*` / `move-*`** — small directional
    nudge in the indicated direction. Could share a `directional-
    nudge` motion module.

12. **`play` / `pause` / `stop` / media controls** — subtle motion
    on activation (play has the famous "morph to pause" — out of
    scope, just animate stroke).

13. **`search`** — magnifying glass wobble or scan.

**Decorative / one-off (do as opportunistic):**

- `sparkle*` / `sparkles` — twinkle (reuse `starTwinkle`?)
- `zap` — lightning flash
- `atom` — orbiting electrons
- `compass` — needle rotation
- `gauge` — needle sweep
- `wind` — drift lines
- `leaf` — fall + spin
- `waves` — oscillation

**Skip / defer:**

- Pure-text icons (`type`, `a-arrow-up`, etc.) — no clear motion.
- Highly abstract icons (`shapes`, `dashes`, generic geometry) — fall
  back to draw is fine.
- Brand logos (if present) — no animation expected.

## 8. Validation & review checklist

Before asking for review on a family:

- [ ] `pnpm --filter lucide-react-motion generate` runs without
      errors and reports the new icon count with signatures.
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` from repo root — all three turbo tasks pass.
- [ ] `pnpm --filter lucide-react-motion test` — all resolver tests
      pass.
- [ ] No unexpected console warnings in dev (the
      `[lucide-react-motion]` ones are intentional but should only
      fire for icons you intentionally haven't covered yet).
- [ ] Visual: open `/playground`, toggle to `signature` mode, hover
      every icon in the family. Each should animate.
- [ ] Visual: each Tier 2 motion *reads as the real thing* (sound
      radiates, flames flicker, hearts beat). No "just scaling" or
      generic motion where physics is expected.
- [ ] Visual: each Tier 1 modifier is quiet enough not to compete
      with the host icon's primary motion.
- [ ] Variants reuse base motions; you didn't re-type physics.
- [ ] Each new motion file has a docstring explaining what it
      animates and which icons consume it.
- [ ] The catalog in section 6 of this doc is updated with new
      motions.

## 9. Known pitfalls

**Path `d` strings vary across variants.** Lucide reshapes the base
shape to accommodate modifiers (`bell-plus` carves out the top-right
of the shell). Strict d-string equality means the base motion won't
match unless you extend its `matchPathDOneOf` list. Always check
whether existing motions match the new variant's paths first; extend
the list if they conceptually should but mechanically don't.

**Transform origin is per-signature, not per-path.** If your
signature uses `transformOrigin: "12px 4px"` (top mount) for the
primary motion, any *scale* on a modifier path will scale from that
point too — not from the modifier's own center. This is sometimes
useful thematically (the bell-ring sound waves scaling from the mount
*reads as* radiation). When it isn't, prefer non-transform animations
for the modifier (`pathLength`, `opacity`) so the wrong origin doesn't
fight you.

**Path order is positional and lucide-controlled.** If you author a
signature that branches on `ctx.index === 0`, a future Lucide update
that reorders paths in the icon would silently break the role
mapping. Always prefer matching by path data (`matchPathD`,
`matchPathDOneOf`), not by index.

**`matchAnyPath` is greedy.** It matches every path, including ones
you didn't intend. Always place `matchAnyPath` motions *last* in the
compose `motions` list, so more specific matches get tried first.

**Don't forget to regenerate.** The codegen reads
`src/modes/signatures/` at generate-time. Writing a new signature
without re-running `pnpm generate` means the icon's wrapper won't
import it. The `prebuild` and `predev` scripts handle this
automatically; you only need to run it manually after writing a
signature outside of those flows.

**The dev warning is your friend.** When something doesn't animate
correctly, check the dev console — browser-side for client renders,
terminal-side for the Next.js server during SSR. The engine warns
once per unmatched path with the iconName, index, and tag. That tells
you exactly which path needs a motion module.
