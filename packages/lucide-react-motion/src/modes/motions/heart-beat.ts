/**
 * Lub-dub heart beat — anatomically correct contract-and-relax rhythm.
 * Rest size is the relaxed (largest) state; each beat is a contraction
 * back toward the icon center. That's what a real heart does during
 * systole, and it keeps the motion entirely within the 24×24 viewBox so
 * the stroke never gets clipped at the edges. Weighted `times` make S2
 * land in quick succession after S1 with a slow settle on the tail,
 * matching the rhythm of a real heartbeat.
 *
 * Lucide reshapes the heart across variants to leave room for whatever
 * modifier the variant carries (plus, minus, x, slash, crack, etc.). Every
 * known heart-shape variation goes through the same lub-dub physics — this
 * list is the registry of "what counts as a heart body." Adding a new heart
 * variant means appending its body `d` string(s) here.
 *
 * Heart-off contributes two fragments (one path per arc, split by the
 * slash); both go through the same beat so the fragments pump together
 * around the icon center, the way a real heart does even when shown
 * silenced.
 *
 * Heart-handshake is intentionally NOT included — its single merged path
 * fuses the heart with the clasping hands and gets its own gentler motion
 * (`heartHandshakeClasp`) so the hands don't inflate.
 */
/**
 * Scale + time keyframes for the heart's lub-dub. Exported so other
 * heart-family motions whose paths are visually *inside* the heart body
 * (the crack zigzag in `heart-crack`, the EKG trace in `heart-pulse`)
 * can apply the same scaling and breathe in sync with the host heart
 * instead of floating statically over a contracting shape.
 *
 * Pattern: an internal motion imports these constants and feeds them
 * into motion's per-value `transition` so its other animated properties
 * (e.g. `pathLength` reveal) can keep their own independent timing.
