/**
 * Soft "shared warmth" pulse for the `heart-handshake` icon.
 *
 * **Constraint**: Lucide draws heart-handshake as a single merged path —
 * the heart on top and the two clasping hands below are one continuous
 * outline, not separable elements. That means any transform applies to
 * the whole thing at once, so we can't pulse the heart while keeping the
 * hands still.
 *
 * **Reading**: rather than fight that constraint, the motion leans into
 * it. The entire icon does a single gentle scale contraction from the
 * icon center — a quiet inhale-and-settle that reads as warmth being
 * shared between the clasped hands. Amplitude is intentionally small
 * (6% inward, scale ≤ 1 per principle 3) so the hands don't visibly
 * contort; the heart sits at icon center where the scale effect is
 * most legible. Inward also reads more anatomically as "clasp" since
 * hands clasping draws inward, not outward.
 *
 * Tier 2 in spirit (the icon depicts a real human moment) but the merged
 * path forces a whole-icon gesture rather than per-element physics.
