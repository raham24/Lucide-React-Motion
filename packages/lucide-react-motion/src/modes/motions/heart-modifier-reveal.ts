/**
 * Heart-family wildcard reveal — `modifierReveal`'s draw-in (pathLength
 * + opacity) plus the host `heartBeat` scale so every non-shell path in
 * a heart variant moves *with* the heart instead of floating statically
 * over a contracting shape.
 *
 * Catches whatever's left after `heartBeat` matches the heart shell:
 * - heart-crack's zigzag crack (inside the heart)
 * - heart-plus / heart-minus / heart-x marker strokes (carved corner)
 * - heart-off's diagonal slash
 *
 * Scale uses `inherit: true` so the host transition's duration / delay
 * / repeat propagate down. Without that, motion-dom replaces the
 * parent transition entirely and the per-value block falls back to its
 * default 300 ms — completely out of sync with the heart's 800 ms beat.
 *
 * Place this last in the compose `motions` list so more specific
 * matches (the heart shell) get tried first.
