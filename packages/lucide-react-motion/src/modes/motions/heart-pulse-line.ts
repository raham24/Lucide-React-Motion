/**
 * EKG trace draw for the `heart-pulse` waveform.
 *
 * **Real-life motion**: a heart monitor draws the trace left-to-right at
 * a constant chart speed, the QRS spike landing as the heart contracts.
 * Modeled with `pathLength` sweeping 0 → 1 at linear ease across the
 * duration so the line "writes itself" along the wave's intrinsic
 * direction, mimicking paper-tape monitors. Opacity comes up on the
 * leading edge so the line doesn't appear instantly — feels like the
 * monitor warming up, then drawing.
 *
 * **Beats with the host heart**: the line passes through the heart's
 * body, so it gets the host `heartBeat` scale keyframes applied too —
 * the trace breathes in sync with the heart's contractions rather than
 * floating statically over a beating shape. Per-value transitions
 * separate the linear paper-tape draw from the scale's lub-dub timing.
 *
 * Tier 2: the EKG trace depicts the heart's electrical signal — an
 * actual physical readout — so it gets bespoke draw-it-in motion rather
 * than the generic `modifierReveal` used for UI markers like + or ×.
