/**
 * The `loader-circle` arc — Lucide's three-quarter-circle stroke that
 * starts at (21, 12) and sweeps clockwise to (14.78, 3.44). Visually
 * it's the canonical SVG/CSS loading spinner: a partial ring chasing
 * its own gap as it rotates.
 *
 * **Real-life motion**: real progress spinners aren't perfectly uniform
 * tachometers — they read as *alive* because of subtle non-linearities
 * in how the loop renders. A pure linear spin (what
 * {@link import("./loader-spin").loaderSpin} provides for the base
 * `loader` icon) feels mechanical. This signature adds two
 * characteristics that make `loader-circle` read as "the system is
 * working":
 *
 * - **Surge-and-settle ease per cycle.** `easeInOut` on the rotation
 *   gives every full revolution a built-in acceleration at the start
 *   and a slight deceleration as the gap rolls back into view —
 *   different feel from the base loader's perfectly linear spin.
 * - **Reflectance breath.** A subtle mid-cycle opacity dim
 *   (≈ 0.78 at t=0.5) reads as the arc passing through a moment of
 *   "load" before the next surge begins. Without it a stationary
 *   spinner can look frozen between gusts of activity; with it the
 *   icon is unmistakably indeterminate progress.
 *
 * Pivots at the icon centre (12, 12) — the signature uses the default
 * `transformOrigin` so the arc rotates around its own geometric
 * centre and never translates.
 *
 * **ViewBox safety**: the arc already lives at full radius 9 inside
 * the 24×24 viewBox, so no scale is applied here — rotation around
 * the centre cannot push the stroke outside. Opacity is a non-
 * transform property and is bounds-safe by construction.
 *
 * Exports `LOADER_CIRCLE_KEYFRAMES` for future loader-family variants
 * that should sit on top of the same surge-and-settle cadence.
